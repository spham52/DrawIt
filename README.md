DrawIt is a web-based drawing game where players attempt to guess each others drawings based on a word chosen by the server.
This project was built using Spring Boot (JDK 21) for the backend and React for the front end, with WebSockets (STOMP Over SockJS) for real-time communication.

Features:
- Real-time websocket communication between players
- Players take turns as the drawer
- Word guessing and round system
- Chatroom integration
- Dockerised frontend and backend for quick deployment
